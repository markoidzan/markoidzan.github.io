... that is the question. I have personally experienced and upgrades and lower version (the best word downgrade) any operating system, any antivirus or perhaps even the most common games (word games is bad for major titles such as GTA, NFS, FIFA, etc.).  
  
OK, after this brief introduction will explain the concepts of construction (by English upgrade) and lower version (by English downgrade). So upgrading is easiest explained - to raise something in the new version. It is often interesting procedure in a small number of attempts goes wrong, ie with an error. In the event that ends with an error there is always hope that they will correct the error in some way (Google is your best friend in cases like this ;) ) *.  
  
Now, why the fuck we sometimes veer slightly to the older version ... New versions are often better than the former, there is no more fatal errors / bugs and other so let's call it crap. So for that there are various reasons and one of the most common is incompatiblity with something and is particularly concerned that the old hardware or perhaps a program that is not working does not work in the new version of the operating system. But for God's sake, there are alternatives and beta versions for people who want to do something for the new version or not ... If there are beta versions, but not all folks "so trivial" **. In fact, sometimes what "seems to have a trivial solution," it does not exist. Sometimes the solution back to the latest stable version, ie the version that is best done in a given time.  
  
The best example of lowering version of the pirate versions of games, and of course the pirate version of Windows 8 is legal (let's say sort-of legal) Windows 7 Now what we're going with Windows 8 to Windows 7 Well, perhaps some things do not work well on Windows 8 than to Windows 7 OK, you're not alone, but what on earth ... So here, I have several applications that we study use, but unfortunately there is no version for Windows 8 / 8.1 in piratebay waters. The bay waters are just versions of Windows 7, so I was there a month working on Windows 8.1 (100% legal, MSDNAA key from Windows 8 worked on 8.1) back to 100% legal Windows 7 Professional (thanks to a study on MSDNAA / Dreamspark Premium account).  
  
UPDATE 17/10/2013: After the first lab exercises I noticed that they finally upgraded the application, and I still go back to Windows 8.1. I did not last long on Windows 7 :P  
  
If you also experienced some upgrades or downgrades, please write them in the comments :).
