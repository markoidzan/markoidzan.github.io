No they are not Linux Distros sf you thought that from the title… These are the two most recent operating system from two oposing sides… And do not question the Android against iOS, but that the other two companies… And if you think it is now well-established feud between Scroogled Microsoft and calm Google, you don't have another chance to think what those two companies are…

Hope you guessed finally… At issue is the long-awaited review between two major updates of operating systems from Microsoft and Apple camps. And those upgrades are so large that they become separate operating systems. For Apple, it’s not surprising, but Microsoft surprised me. You could have it all out as a single service pack for Windows 8, but they do not have to invent something new.

And before I start with reviewing the two new operating systems from this year I will mention what hardware I used.

**CPU:** Intel Core i3-2100@3.2 GHz  
**Motherboard:** ASRock H61M-VS with the latest BIOS on it  
**Graphics Card:** Palit GeForce GT 440 with 1GB DDR3 memory  
**RAM:** 4 GB (1x4GB)  
**Hard Disk Drive:** 500 GB Seagate Barracuda  
**Other hardware:** CoolerMaster case with built-in PSU with 450W, DVD-RW optical drive from an unknown manufacturer, Logitech MK120 set of keyboard and mouse, Minton MWC 7105 webcam

As you can see from the computer age it can run newer games such are Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty Ghosts on low setting, but it is story for another day.

How do I partitioned disk I explained in the previous post about hackintosh I’m from which I'm working now and it is running for three weeks. Each OS has its advantages but also its disadvantages, and will be classified into 4 main categories:

  1. Loading speed of operating system and its general behavior
  2. Gaming (oh know for OS X and I have games on my Steam account)
  3. Basic applications to run on the system
  4. New capabilities

## 1) Loading Speed of operating systems and their general behavior

It is well known that I have a Chameleon boot-loader so that all time measurements were started out by loading from the boot-loader up to the end of the system loading with the basic applications that can be started on computer start-up. Some of these applications for both systems are: Dropbox, SkyDrive (now OneDrive), Google Drive, Comodo Antivirus (Internet Security Premium on Windows), Steam and drivers for all phardware (drivers to read HFS + partitions on Windows and NTFS partitions on OS X). As an additional delay at all, I need to enter passwords for computer work.

According to some average starting times OS X start time is slightly higher. The average time of starting up OS X is 10 seconds to login screen, and then another 30 seconds until all the other applications do not load until the very end.

When Windows is a similar situation when it comes to coming up login screen. Yet now I’ll be realistic and say that Windows is faster in this regard. That is the average time to reach this screen is 3 to 5 seconds, depending on the day to day that is how the computer rebooted the system (I thought of when it suits him the male sexual organ but let’s be a little more established with some clever statements). In the second part of the starting up windows are slower for some 10-ish seconds, but just want to add OS X. This slower because of audio drivers and applications like Origin.

Both systems are relatively stable (there are minor flaws but those are miserable) and most normal applications that use work without problems (except for Chrome for OS X, but it’s still a story for some other day). Anyway, the main web browser on OS X is Safari.

## 2) Gaming (games from Steam)

Now we come to the painful point of all users of OS X and Linux. In fact there are some titles (for example it is Euro Truck Simulator 2) that I play on a regular basis. But this games I tried on OS X (Half-Life 2, DLC Quest and The Showdown Effect) had an average frame rate about 60FPS, and there were no significant slowdowns in games.

On Windows, everything works smoothly, there are some frame drops but nothing special. As I mentioned in one of the previous reviews starting games is faster then on the previous versions of Windows.

## 3) Basic applications to run on the system

I will only say a few things and here they are in briefly:

  * everything should be there as a free (“free” for certain things) alternative to the opposite system (example: Sony Vegas Pro with Windows has an equivalent in Final Cut Pro X).
  * Chrome on OS X has some problems with really slow loading pages or uploading them. On Windows does not have the same problems, so I doubt that Chrome had their “time of the month”. Other browsers are working normally and had no major problems.
  * Office is preinstalled and without the need to install packages to work fine, because the plain Preview works wonders. I say this for OS X, and Windows is known to need to have some sort of Office package, like LibreOffice.
  * Multimedia works perfectly because VLC works on both systems.
  * Finder vs. Windows Explorer to give much more to describe, but the advantage is in my opinion the Finder. But still prefer Explorer however as it sounded strange.

## 4) New Capabilities

Honestly to tell you some things. On OS X is my least new Facebook integration everywhere. Before it was Twitter, but now there’s Facebook integration, which is very good. New Mail and Calendar are good and it has synchronized with the Exchange server (College mail infrastructure for the Exchange so it’s good) and Gmail.

In Windows, the most important new thing is the automatic loading to Desktop without other applications. Everything else is less important to me, it is essential that this option exists.

**CONCLUSION**: Both systems are good, each in their own way. I’d rather be on Windows unless you really do not need some OS X stuff like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and of course when I want to test something on safari.

_**Rating OS X Mavericks:**_ 8/10 (minor flaws spoil the impression)

_**Windows 8.1 rating:**_ 7.5/10 (slower boot spoils the experience, and while he has a tiny blemish).

All in all this is a short review 1vs1 both systems. Your experiences can write in the comments, and some will probably sometimes mentioned.
