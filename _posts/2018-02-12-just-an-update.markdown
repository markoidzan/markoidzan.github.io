For this web site and blog.

So, as you all might see this is my (Marko's) old blog.

For all new blog posts please visit [https://idzan.eu/blog](https://idzan.eu/blog)

As for state of this blog, well it would be restored to fully functional state soon, but for now need to implement old IFTTT support so it can post latest YouTube videos here.

And as you all can see, this is now "monetized" blog with AdSense & Video Intelligence (vi) ads and CoinHive miner script. Please have in mind that you can support this blog by checking interesting ads (and videos too) for you or you can just use CoinHive from Page's Sidebar.

In near future there should be Affiliates and Referrals page with all links, but for that you should be all informed. It is currently building on main web site =)

Privacy Policy and Terms of Service for this site with Cookie Consent is in WIP state for now.
