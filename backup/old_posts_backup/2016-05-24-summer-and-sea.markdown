title: Summer and sea
---
That combination of awesome! And I know that very good in this manner.

For me summer is best part of year. It is time when you can actually relax after exams weeks, college, school and even job. I love summer. And especially love it when I go to sea.

Sea, one awesome place here on planet earth. It is great to see that blue part of world. Why I love sea. Well, I love it because I go there almost every year in past 6 summers.

And now, in next 24 hours after releasing this post I would be in bus with bunch of friends on our way to sea. Early summer here we go 😎
