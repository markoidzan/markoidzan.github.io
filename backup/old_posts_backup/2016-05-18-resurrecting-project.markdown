title: Resurrecting project
---

Yes, I know you might think about this but nope it is something else.

What you might ask, and here I would answer something like this: something special.

That's right, I would go with relearning one skill to resurrect that project.

It took me a lot of time first time when I was doing it, and now 2.5 years after first try I'm gonna try again. If it fails then I know what is process of doing next: scraping idea and project and never gonna be found in my silly head.

Meanwhile, in next week or so here should be released review of current smartphone that I'm using for almost a month.

Until next blog post, peace out.
