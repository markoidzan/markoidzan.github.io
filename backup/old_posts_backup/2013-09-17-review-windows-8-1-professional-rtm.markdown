At the thought that I very early start to use a new operating system, I think is, "Hey, what's perhaps foolish to use a leak there ... Is it not wiser to wait of October that then everyone says it should be and what's wrong ... or more risks as well as with Windows 8 and where people describe the advantages and disadvantages of where the new OS? So come on risk will probably pay "  
  
I just tell you that the risk is about putting Windows 8.1, and it paid off many times :D.  
  
And before I get to explain why 8.1 is better than its predecessor, I should publish the specifications of my computer (by which I do not know any way to the current blog, but good is not a problem ??).  
  
**CPU:** Intel Core i3 2100@3.2 GHz  
**Motherboard:** ASRock H61M-VS with Ivy Bridge universal compatibility BIOS  
**Graphics Card:** Palit GeForce GT 440 with 1GB DDR3 memory  
**RAM:** 4 GB (1 * 4GB)  
**Disk Drive:** 500 GB Seagate Baracuda divided into three partitions  
**Other hardware:** CoolerMaster enclosure with built Corded than 450W, DVD-RW optical drive an unknown manufacturer, Logitech km120 set of keyboard and mouse, Minton MWC 7105 webcam, Bluetooth 2.0 adapter unknown manufacturer (older device)  
  
The enclosed shows that the machine can spin and Battlefield 4 (well not exactly on Ultra settings, perhaps only at Medium to 1280 * 1024), but it is not part of this announcement.  
  
To test the first review I use the WZOR / WzT leak that is safe and can be found on the MDL-in. Of course I use x64 version because where to x86 go on the 4GB RAM :P  
  
Firstly I must mention one thing, it's not made ​​Clean Install for upgrade to Windows 7 Professional SP1 x64. The reason for this is that I have a mountain of necessary documents, pictures, videos and music that you will not have to copy the USB's and again with the USB's back on the comp.  
  
The installation itself is very quick to upgrade from older Windows. Installation took them 30 minutes (plus-minus which 5-10 minutes, I was at the computer when exercised upgrade). For installation you must obtain Generic Windows 8.1 key (unfortunately does not accept original Windows 8 Professional Dreamspark Premium key to install). After installation follows a classic update drivers. In this configuration, it is necessary to update the sound driver because everyone else is immediately identified (as with Win 8).  
  
Activation is for users with MSDN / Technet / Dreamspark Premium / Retail users of Windows 8 piece of cake that is so light that it can not be easier. All you need is your key of Windows 8, a minute or two of work to enter the key and of course a stable Internet connection. Can it be that simple ;)  
  
The vast majority of programs that I used on Windows 7 works on 8.1. The only exception is the Comodo Firewall. I can not wait to come officially Comodos Firewall to 8.1 and again agree that a good Internet Protection (currently have installed Defender / Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Firewall plus mandatory extra scanners that can respond to the names of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware,  Hitman.PRO and Emsisoft Emergency Kit) .  
  
Game 8.1 is much more streamlined than Windows 8 or even 7. Short in comparison, NFS World on Windows 7 spins at 40FPS and with High settings at 1280 * 1024 while the 8.1 spins at about 55-60FPS is. See an improvement?  
  
And now for the conclusion I will say one thing. Skip Windows 8, and immediately go to Windows 8.1, and you will love it because of the opportunities that are thrown at him (Boot to Desktop is built into the system as well as some options for which they should have some type of program Start8 and similar).  
  
**Rating**: 9/10 (Comodo come to speed up the release of the software to 8.1)
